# ag-Grid Material Theme with Custom Sizing

The sample project demonstrates how to change the row / header / icon size of ag-Grid's material theme. 

Notice that for the changes to take effect, 
the sizes should be changed both in the `gridOptions` configuration in `example.js` and in the `styles.scss` file.

Note: To keep things simple, the Webpack configuration presented here is the simplest one possible. The output from it is not optimized for production. 
For more in-depth production configuration setup, please review the [Webpack guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/).
